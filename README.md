# reviews-slider
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Reviews project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and learnings
Review Cards is a simple reviews slider display.

The main React functionalities I learned are how to dynamically display the next and the previous review and also a random review. I made my own setup, styling and added an extra feature to the original idea of the project.
